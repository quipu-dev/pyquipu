  ## test: Detects cycles in a graph represented by parent pointers.

  Uses a standard Depth-First Search traversal. For each node, it traverses
  up the parent chain, keeping track of the nodes in the current path. If a
  node is encountered that is already in the current path, a cycle is detected.

  ## test: SQLite reader should not create a graph with cycles from corrupted data.

  This test ensures that `SQLiteHistoryReader.load_all_nodes` can gracefully
  handle a corrupted `edges` table where a node incorrectly lists itself as
  its own parent. The reader should ignore this edge and not produce an
  in-memory graph with a cycle, which would otherwise cause infinite loops.
