  ## test: Verify parent-child linkage during idempotent operations.

  When two consecutive nodes produce the exact same Output Tree Hash (idempotent operation),
  the SQLite writer must ensure that the second node points to the first node as its parent,
  rather than pointing to itself (self-loop) or getting confused by the identical tree hash.
